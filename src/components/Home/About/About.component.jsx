								interactive and fun activity by organising various events in

								horse that the Greeks hid inside of during the Trojan War. The
								Trojans, thinking the horse was a gift, opened their walled city
								to accept it, allowing the Greeks to come out of hiding at night
								to attack the sleeping people of Troy. Likewise we Trojans of

								encouraging the young minds of this generation to invoke the
