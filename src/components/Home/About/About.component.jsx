                Technology. Trojans emerged from the shadows on March 13th,
                2022. Trojans aims to provide a platform for students to explore
                and exhibit their talents as well as learn about various
                technologies that persist in the IT industry. Our name is
                inspired from the historical trojan horse, which was a clever
                instrument used in the trojan war to turn the tides of the war.
                Our symposium, was also conceived by similar clever maneuvers
                and has now become a phenomenon of great significance and flair.
